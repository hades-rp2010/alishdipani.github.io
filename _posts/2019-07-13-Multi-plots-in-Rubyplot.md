# Introduction
This blog lists down the Multi plots in Rubyplot with ImageMagick as backend and highlights the work done in Week 5 and 6 for GSoC 2019.  
  
Multi plots are plots which combine multiple plots of the same kind in the same subplot i.e. the same `axes` object. In Rubyplot, even if one plot is specified, it is considered as a multi plot i.e. a single bar plot is considered as multi bar plot.  
P.S. - The version of Rubyplot used in this blog is dated 13th July.
