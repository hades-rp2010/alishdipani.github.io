I am a third year undergraduate from [BITS Pilani, Goa Campus, India](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/) with a Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) in Electrical and Communications Engineering and a Minor in Physics.  
  
My Research Interests lie in Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Psychology, Cognitive sciences, Causality, Computational neuroscience, and the intersections of these respective fields. I am also exploring how Deep Reinforcement learning algorithms can be made more generalizable and sample efficient by drawing from how humans learn and what kind of prior information humans use for extremely efficient learning.

Currently, I work as a Research Fellow at [Maritime Research Centre, Pune](http://mrc.foundationforuda.in/), working on ML based methods for underwater acoustic modelling.
