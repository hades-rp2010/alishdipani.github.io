* **GenRL**
  [CODE](https://github.com/SforAiDl/genrl)|[DOCS](https://genrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  
  A PyTorch reinforcement learning library centered around reproducible and generalizable algorithm implementations. Currently contributing to the *Model Based* part of the library

* **Exploration of RL algorithms**

* **Reinforcement Learning on Easy21**
  [CODE](https://github.com/hades-rp2010/Easy21-RL)  
  Developed an environment to simulate playing of Easy21 and tried out Monte Carlo Control and TD learning to learn the value functions

* **Deep Q learning on Atari Games**
  [CODE](https://github.com/hades-rp2010/SAiDL-Summer-Assignment-2019/blob/master/Starter_code_RL_2%20(1).ipynb)  
  Experimented with DQN algorithms to play Ms Pacman in a simulated gym environment

* **Study of optimizers**
  [CODE](https://github.com/hades-rp2010/Saidl-Winter-assignment-2019/blob/master/jax_opti.ipynb)  
  Study and comparison of various popular optimizers, coded from scratch using [JAX]()

* **One shot Classification using transfer learning**
  [CODE](https://github.com/hades-rp2010/Saidl-Winter-assignment-2019/blob/master/Omniglot_siamese_net.ipynb)  
  Used transfer learning techniques to improve performance of a Siamese network for one shot learning on the Omniglot dataset.
