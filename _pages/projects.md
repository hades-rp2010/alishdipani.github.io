* **Image Segmentation of nuclei**
  * Duration: January 2018 - April 2018
  * Mentor: [Dr. Bijil Prakash]()
  * Description: Segmented slide images containing multiple nuclei to output a single grayscale image of all segmented nuclei. Implemented a model inspired by U-net in python using PyTorch.

* **Neural Style Transfer on Audio Signals**
  * Duration: September 2017 â€“ December 2017
  * Description: Modified the Neural Style transfer algorithm for Audio to create new music using a content audio and a style audio. Implemented in python using PyTorch.
