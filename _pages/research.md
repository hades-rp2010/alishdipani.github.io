* **Timeseries Forecasting and Classificaion of GNSS signals using DL**
  * Worked on developing deep learning methods to forecast Total Electron Content (TEC) in the ionosphere and predict scintilation in in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals at [Digital Communication Lab, BITS Pilani, Goa](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/Electrical/dcl).

* **ML Based Underwater channel Model**
  [Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tRgPGfmzbSJOmTDtCyiyXDsk7eSRvD74K_6HIm6MkSc/edit?usp=sharing) | [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YZsSH97GzJmBlnswvm9XOv_34feMFyLp0523CKVFjxg/edit?usp=sharing)
  * Worked on developing novel ML methods to estimate the Transmission Loss between two entities communication underwater
  * Given previous methods (The Parabolic equation Range Dependent Acoustic Model) based on solving differential equations numerically, the method attains approximately 80x speedup
  * Work done as a summer Intern at [Maritime Research Centre, Pune](http://mrc.foundationforuda.in/)
